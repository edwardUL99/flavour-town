To make working on the project easier, you should download GitHub Desktop to your computer, where you can sign in and 'clone' this repository
This will essentially copy it into a normal folder on your computer where you can easily drop files into it

GitHub Desktop will keep track of any changes to this folder and if there are changes it will prompt you to upload them to origin(here) on
the branch you chose. You will have to commit the changes then

GitHub has a Hello World project to help you out

https://desktop.github.com/

Download it and install it, sign in and it will come up asking to create new reository or clone one. Click clone and choose the repository
