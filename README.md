How To Play:
On your first launch you are presented with a tutorial guiding you through the basics.
You must collect food combinations using the "skewer" part of your character and avoid
hitting objects with your body (Both the body and "skewer" are outlined in the tutorial)

Movement:
1)You can move using WASD (Defaults however you can change them), arrow keys or drag the character
with the mouse.
2)If dragging, ensure you don't crash too quickly into foods as you may "choke" the player
(i.e. hurt them)

Settings:
The settings allow you to change the speed of the character that he moves at when being
moved by keys, the volume and the keys you can use to play the game

Journal:
The journal keeps track of your high score and also the food combos you have collected
